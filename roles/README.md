**Welcome to My Ansible Automation Repo!**

# Ansible

This is my personal take on deploying and automating infrastructure using Ansible. I haven't used Ansible before and I don't think it is easy. Though, it is easier then reinventing the wheel :-)

The aim is to deply and configure my infrastructure in a clean and modern way after I have made the initial PVE host and VMs ready with my [Proxmox repo](https://github.com/PCH-ApS/proxmox).

While I’ve worked in tech for a long time, I haven’t been in a developer role for almost 20 years — and there’s a lot I’ve had to relearn especially on automation. I have a clear vision of what I want to build, but I also knew I’d need help, so I leaned on AI to suggest better tooling, and guide my structure. 

My focus with this repo is to be able to deploy and configyre my server in my infrastructure. I want to have everything in config files, so I can recreate everything (expect data) with IaC, should I ever have the need, and at the same time maintain my config. Whenever I need to change anything, I hope I will be able to adjust the config files and rerun the playbooks.
